# CityWeather Web App

## About the project
CityWeather is a simple weather app built on the OpenWeatherMap API.
Using this app you can enter the name of cities around the world and it will give you the current weather data along with the 5 day forecaset, and the Air Quality Health Index.
You can try it out [here](https://cityweatherapp.onrender.com/) (***note: it takes a while to load***)
